\section{Introduction}
	For us to be capable of exploring the central problem explained later in this paper, we must develop machinery in order to replicate the intuitive notion of a walk on different surfaces.
	Most of this machinery has been developed in the field of differential geometry and we have learned a lot of this material from \cite{BanchoffLovett_DiffGeo_2010} (Read it for a more detailed explanation of this material).
	We will begin with a general overview of differential manifolds that are locally Euclidean.
	
	\subsection{Euclidean Surfaces}
		The introduction to parametrized surfaces given in \cite{BanchoffLovett_DiffGeo_2010} is most readily adapted to this project because it can be easily implemented in computer programming.
		We construct a surface as a subset of $\R^3$ by considering continuous functions $\mu:U\subseteq\R^2 \to \R^3$ --- we call the set of $\mu$ that covers the entire surface in question a \textit{chart}.
		Glossing over the large amount of detail and development that can be extracted from this simple idea of a surface, we apply more restrictions on the surfaces (and their charts) in order to obtain an intuitive "smoothness" on the surface.
		In a sense, these restrictions allow us to consider surfaces that are locally Euclidean (hence the name for this class of surfaces arise --- also known as \textit{regular} or \textit{differentiable} surfaces).
		

\section{Derivation of Geodesic Equations}
	
	\subsection{Christoffel Symbols}
		In order for the implementation of the geodesic equations in C\texttt{++} to be simpler, we change the domain of the standard charts for the sphere and the torus to be the unit square $I^2 = [0,1) \times [0,1)$.
		This will yield slightly different Christoffel Symbols for both of these manifolds (and their charts).
		First, we will calculate the Christoffel Symbols for the sphere $S^2$ mapped with the chart $\mu:I^2 \to S^2$ defined by
		$$ \mu(u,v) = (\cos(2\pi u)\sin(\pi v), \sin(2\pi u)\cos(\pi v), \cos(\pi v)) $$
		which has the corresponding Christoffel Symbols
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{array}{lr}
			\left(\Gamma^{u}_{ij}\right) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
					0 & \pi\cot(\pi v) \\
					\pi\cot(\pi v) & 0
				\end{array} \right) &
			\left(\Gamma^{v}_{ij}\right) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
					-2\pi\sin(2\pi v) & 0 \\
					0 & 0
				\end{array} \right)
			\end{array}
		\end{equation}
